AIM: Creating AWS Account, EC2 instance & Configuration

a) Sign into your aws account then
Goto EC2 > Launch instance

b) Once clicked on Launch instance give your Instance a name (I’ve given Django Test 2), you also need to select the OS (in this case I have selected UBUNTU as this is more familiar and offered free by aws,  however you are free to choose any)

c) Create a new key-pair or use one if you have already created
A key pair, consisting of a public key and a private key, is a set of security credentials that you use to prove your identity when connecting to an Amazon EC2 instance. For more info: Amazon EC2 key pairs and Linux instances - Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud

d) These are the basic steps to configure EC2 instance, Now Click on Launch instance > Connect

Note: If you see such errors, wait patiently as the Instances take time to startup you can check the progress/state of your created instance on your running EC2 Instance window )
